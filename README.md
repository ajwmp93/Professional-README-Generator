  ## Description
  I created this project to quickly be able to create a README.md file from the terminal line rather than having to go in and format a file myself.

  ## Installation
  None

  ## Usage
  When in the folder, in the terminal, write node index.js and answer the prompts as they come up. Once you have gone through and answered everything, a new file will be created.
